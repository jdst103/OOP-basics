# OOP Basics - :tacos:

This files are basics for OOP.

## Topics we will cover

**4 Pillars**:
- Abstraction
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism
- Encapsulation

Other learning objectives:
 - Git + Github
 - Documentation and Markdown files
 - Best practice and organisation
 
 ## Definitions
 
#### class
Class is a blue print for objects. (Or a cookie cutter..)
Inside we define how object's characteristics and behaviours it can do.

With classes, you can create instances of that class. 

####instance (Or a cookie)
The occurrence of an object of a specific class.

#### attributes
The are variables (or constants) that are attached to a object of a specific class.

#### class attributes
Attached to EVERY instance of a specific class

#### method 
is a like a function, but can only run on a specific Datatype or object of its own class.
 
####__init__ method
is a method, that runs every time you initialize/create an object using a class.
AKA: constructor method. 

#### self
-> refers to the instance
in a method, self is the specific instance. 

#### Pillars
this is the definition for the pillars.

#### Abstraction 
This is hidding complexity, and gives our user only what they need to make things work.
Think of it like a black box. 

EXAMPLES real life:
- Shifting gears in a car, the gearbox and transmission systemn are abstracted from us.
- Heating up food in the microwave, the process and physics are abstracted and we get hot food from just pushing a button

in code: 
The methods: split() or .append() for strings and list are abstracted. we only see the see the documentation. 

We will do the same.
- seperate the class definition from running it (seperation of concerns)
- provided some documentation on the available methods. (provide a README
with methods and how to use them)
 
 
#### inheritance
ability to inherit all the behaviour and characteristics of parent class

and then define your own.
